    <h1>Hello everyone!</h1>



    <p>On February 18, 2024, we started learning about CSS with our teacher Djellza Hajrullahu. We learned about
        the types of CSS, its characteristics, and an introduction to CSS.</p>


    <h2>I am a subheading</h2>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to design web pages. It allows developers to
        control the layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness of a website. CSS can be applied in three ways:
        inline, internal, and external. With CSS, websites can be made visually appealing and user-friendly.</p>

    <h3>I am another subheading</h3>
    <p>Subheadings are secondary headings used to organize and break down content within a document, article, or
        webpage. They help improve readability by dividing the text into smaller, more manageable sections.
        Subheadings provide a clear structure, guiding readers through different topics or points within a main
        section.</p>

    <h1>I am another heading</h1>
    <p>Subheadings could include:
        "Types of CSS"
        "CSS Selectors and Properties"
        "Advantages of Using CSS"</p>
